## Dataset 
labels:
0 - human created
1 - AI generated

Download the dataset store it in a folder named `dataset` in the project root. The dataset folder should contain 2 folders, `train_data`, `test_data`, and 2 files, `train.csv`, `test.csv`

Since, our `test.csv` file does not contain labels but just image ids, we'll have to use the `train.csv` for training, testing and validating.
